There two ways of viewing the solution:
1. Open the web_log_challenge.ipynb file to view code and results together (Recommended)
2. You can also use spark-submit by running the web_log_challenge.py.(Job completes in under 4 mins) 
3. Results for most_engaged_users and unique_urls_per_session are attached separately in csv format
4. Result of average session time was calculated to be 1480.90984195 seconds
5. The window time for each session was chosen to be 15 mins=900 seconds.
6. The code instructions said we could use any extra libraries therefore I have used pandas and numpy for this task. Make sure these 
libararies are installed before running SparkSubmit.
7. There are further comments to explain the meaning of each function within the code.
